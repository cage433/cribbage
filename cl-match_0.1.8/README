This is the README file for cl-match 0.1.8, 
an extended--ML-style pattern-matching library for Common Lisp.

LOADING

There are three ways to load cl-match:
* load the file load.lisp in this directory
* asdf-install :cl-match
* asdf-load the system files in this directory:
  * standard-cl   (general-purpose library)
  * cl-match      (pattern matching)
  * pcl-unit-test (unit testing framework)
  * cl-match-test (unit tests)

To learn how to use asdf, see the online asdf documentation here:
http://constantly.at/lisp/asdf/Using-asdf-to-load-systems.html

TESTING

To test cl-match after loading, 
evaluate the form (cl-match-test::test-match).
cl-match has been tested on SBCL and Allegro CL.

NOTES

* There's an html user's manual in the doc directory.
* pcl-unit-test is based on Peter Seibel's book Practical Common Lisp.
* cl-match is based in part on fare-matcher, by Fare Rideau.

Please direct any and all bug reports to cl-match-devel@common-lisp.net,
